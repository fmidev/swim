It is post-processed information from ECMWF input data and it is intended to air traffic planner, airport maintenance, air traffic control, airlines and pilots to help and prepare for Winter weather conditions. Ensemble forecast has 6 classes for precipitation: snow (solid), sleet (solid and liquid), rain (liquid), drizzle (liquid, small droplets), freezing drizzle  (liquid, small drops, below freezing point) and  freezing rain (liquid, below freezing point). The probability of precipitation is expressed as a percentage. Presipitation types can be called all at once or in desired groups or individually.",
